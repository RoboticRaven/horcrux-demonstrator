The folder structure of this project has grown organically, thus not everything is optimally named. (refactoring is very tedious in node-red)
As a consequence of this fact, the node-red specific folder under ``/mca-sp-bops/mca-data/lib`` folder is logically out of place, but there is no functional impact.

3.2 Verbal description
The project can be characterized as a sum of the following:
- the contents of the base folder such as:
	- the ``docker-compose.yml`` containing the blueprint of the service 
	- a ``LICENSE`` file
	- this ``README`` file
	
- a project source folder (``/mca-sp-bops/``) that also holds the ephemeral data that is created at run-time consisting of:
	- subfolders ``bops1-data, bops2-data, ipfs, issuer-data, mca-data`` represent the file root for the corresponding actors of the protocol
	- subfolder ``static`` containing data that is delivered to the end-user (Front-End)
	- subfolder ``mca-data/lib`` that contains the actual node-red code

- a resources folder containing the following:
	- build-artifacts used to create our customized node-red image at ``resources/nodeRed-customImage``:							
		- a dockerfile (containing the required project dependencies)
		- a build-script to render an docker-image from the mentioned dockerfile
		- a script for pushing the custom-image to dockerhub
		- a package.json to install custom libraries via npm after it's creation (in subfolder ``mca``)

	
Development took place on a virtual machine inside VMWare Workstation Pro using the (at the time of development) most recent version of Ubuntu. It is recommended to the same or a comparable (*nix-like) setup.

## 2. Setup
You may run this software project via any of the following options:
### OPTION I: Execute as docker-image:
- Proceed with instructions given in chapter ``3.1 Project setup``.

### OPTION II: Download our fully prepared ova-based virtual machine:
	- project folder is on the desktop (/home/max/Desktop/horcrux-demonstrator)
	- username: max 
	- password: muster
	- use firefox, bookmarks for relevant endpoints have already been added to the toolbar
- Proceed with instructions given in chapter ``3.2 Run the code``. 

### OPTION III: Manual setup
Preparation: Set up a Linux environment. The following setup is recommended:
- Ubuntu LTS on VMWare Workstation Pro 
- recommended: change keyboard layout to German (Switzerland)
- optional: install open-vm-tools for improved UX (resolution- and clipboard-support) if scaling and copy-paste doesn't work.
- Proceed with instructions given in chapter ``3.1 Project setup``.

## 3. Usage
### 3.1 Project setup
1. Open a terminal
2. Install docker if not already installed: https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/
3. Install docker-compose if not already installed: https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/
4. Clone the repository:
- provided you have associated (with GitHub) ssh key: ``git clone git@github.com:RoboticRaven/horcrux-demonstrator.git`` 
- else you may still pull via http protocol ``git clone https://github.com/RoboticRaven/horcrux-demonstrator.git``

### 3.2 Run the code
Some of the following commands require administrative privileges that can be given either by access control facilities of the OS, such as user/group rights or the use of ``sudo``. It is assumed that the user has no administrative privileges and must gain them by using ``sudo``.


1. Change directory (``cd``) into the project directory
2. Start the service by running ``sudo docker-compose up -d`` 
3. The node-red development environment should by now be reachable via browser:
	http://localhost:1000/
4. For testing the functionalities the following mock end-points are available:
	- http-endpoint for registration (as provided in the mca flow): http://localhost:1000/register
	- http-endpoint for login (as provided in the SP(verifier) flow): http://localhost:1000/login
5. Register an identity with the testing data we provided in ``resources/test-data``
6. Open a new page, go to etherscan and check the transactions of our BOPS1 server - yours should pop up within seconds!
7. Once the transaction is confirmed, go back to the registration page that contained your DID, copy the full string (including the did: prefix) and either click the ``test`` link on the top right of the page, or navitage explicity to http://localhost:1000/login
8. You are presented with a mock service allowing you to test the authentication sequence, feel free to mess around. (Be aware that you will have to re-enter the DID each time you retry the authentication process by navigating back to the login page, this is a limitation of the current implementation)

Also notice:
- In order to see the container logs, which can be useful for inspecting some async logging:
	- get an overview over the currently running services
	 ``"sudo docker ps -a"``
	- identify the containerID of the corresponding container and get the logs by running
	 ``"sudo docker logs <containerID>``
